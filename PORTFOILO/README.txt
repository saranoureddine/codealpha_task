1. Services:
A dedicated section detailing the services I offer, showcasing my expertise and the value I bring to potential clients.

2. Resume:
An interactive area where visitors can view or download my resume, making it easy for them to understand my professional background.

3. Projects:
A gallery of my previous work, highlighting various projects I’ve completed, along with detailed descriptions and outcomes.

4. Contact Me:
A user-friendly contact form that allows visitors to get in touch with me directly, making it simple for potential clients or collaborators to reach out.
