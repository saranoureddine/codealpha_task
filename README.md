I encountered a problem uploading the video to my LinkedIn profile, which has caused a delay in sharing the updates. Despite multiple attempts, the upload was unsuccessful. I apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.

Current Status
To ensure that you can still view the updates, I have included a video and README file for each project below:

Portfolio Website

Video
README: Provides an overview of the portfolio website, including features such as Services, Resume, Projects, and Contact Me.
ChatGPT Integration

Video
README: Details the integration of ChatGPT into the web application, highlighting real-time communication and interactive features.
Expense Tracker

Video
README: Explains the functionality of the expense tracker, including expense recording, viewing, deletion, and local storage.
I hope to resolve the issue with LinkedIn soon and will update my profile accordingly. In the meantime, please refer to the provided files for detailed information about each project.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.
