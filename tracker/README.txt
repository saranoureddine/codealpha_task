I’ve developed an expense tracker that stores data in local storage. This tool helps users keep track of their expenses with features such as:

Add Expense: Record new expenses with details like amount, category, and date.
View Expenses: Display a list of all recorded expenses.
Delete Expense: Remove entries when no longer needed.
Local Storage: All data is saved in the browser’s local storage for easy access and persistence.
This project is perfect for anyone looking to manage their finances efficiently without relying on external services.
