 I recently integrated ChatGPT into a web application using WebSocket for real-time communication. This feature allows users to interact with the chatbot for various purposes, including:

Information: Get answers to your queries.
Assistance: Receive help with tasks or questions.
Entertainment: Enjoy interactive and engaging conversations.
This integration enhances the user experience by providing real-time responses and dynamic interactions.

Special thanks to CodeAlpha for their support and inspiration throughout these projects!
